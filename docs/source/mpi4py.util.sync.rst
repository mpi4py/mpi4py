mpi4py.util.sync
----------------

.. module:: mpi4py.util.sync
   :synopsis: Synchronization utilities.

.. versionadded:: 4.0.0

The :mod:`mpi4py.util.sync` module provides parallel synchronization
utilities.

Sequential execution
++++++++++++++++++++

.. autoclass:: mpi4py.util.sync.Sequential

   Context manager for sequential execution within a group of MPI processes.

   The implementation is based in MPI-1 point-to-point communication. A process
   with rank *i* waits in a blocking receive until the previous process rank
   *i-1* finish executing and signals the next rank *i* with a send.

   .. automethod:: __init__
   .. automethod:: __enter__
   .. automethod:: __exit__
   .. automethod:: begin
   .. automethod:: end

Global counter
++++++++++++++

.. autoclass:: mpi4py.util.sync.Counter

   Produce consecutive values within a group of MPI processes. The counter
   interface is close to that of `itertools.count`.

   The implementation is based in MPI-3 one-sided operations. A root process
   (typically rank ``0``) holds the counter, and its value is queried and
   incremented with an atomic RMA *fetch-and-add* operation.

   .. automethod:: __init__
   .. automethod:: __iter__
   .. automethod:: __next__
   .. automethod:: next
   .. automethod:: free

Mutual exclusion
++++++++++++++++

.. autoclass:: mpi4py.util.sync.Mutex

   Establish a critical section or mutual exclusion among MPI processes. The
   mutex interface is close to that of `threading.Lock`. However, its intended
   uses and specific semantics are somewhat different:

   * A mutex should be used within a group of MPI processes, not threads.
   * Once acquired, a mutex is held and owned by a process until released.
   * Trying to acquire a mutex already held raises `RuntimeError`.
   * Trying to release a mutex not yet held raises `RuntimeError`.

   This mutex implementation uses the scalable and fair spinlock algorithm from
   [mcs-paper]_ and took inspiration from the MPI-3 RMA implementation of
   [uam-book]_.

.. autoclass:: mpi4py.util.sync.RMutex

   Establish a critical section or mutual exclusion among MPI processes. The
   mutex interface is close to that of `threading.RLock`, allowing for
   recursive acquire and release operations. However, the mutex should be used
   within a group of MPI processes, not threads.

   The implementation is based on a `Mutex` providing mutual exclusion and a
   counter tracking the recursion level.

   .. automethod:: __init__
   .. automethod:: __enter__
   .. automethod:: __exit__
   .. automethod:: acquire
   .. automethod:: release
   .. automethod:: count
   .. automethod:: free
