.. topic:: Abstract

   This document describes the *MPI for Python* package. *MPI for
   Python* provides Python bindings for the *Message Passing
   Interface* (MPI) standard, allowing Python applications to exploit
   multiple processors on workstations, clusters and supercomputers.

   This package builds on the MPI specification and provides an object
   oriented interface resembling the MPI-2 C++ bindings. It supports
   point-to-point (sends, receives) and collective (broadcasts,
   scatters, gathers) communication of any *picklable* Python object,
   as well as efficient communication of Python objects exposing the
   Python buffer interface (e.g. NumPy arrays and builtin
   bytes/array/memoryview objects).
