:Abstract:     This document describes the *MPI for Python* package. 
	       *MPI for Python* provides bindings of the 
	       *Message Passing Interface* (MPI) standard for the 
	       Python programming language, allowing any Python 
	       program to exploit multiple processors.
	       
	       This package is constructed on top of the MPI-1/2
	       specifications and provides an object oriented
	       interface which closely follows MPI-2 C++ bindings. It
	       supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and
	       collective (broadcasts, scatters, gathers)
	       communications of any *picklable* Python object, as
	       well as optimized communications of Python object
	       exposing the single-segment buffer interface (NumPy
	       arrays, builtin bytes/string/array objects)
